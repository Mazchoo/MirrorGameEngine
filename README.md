## Description

Demonstration of a game using interaction from camera interaction from the user. Demontrates the kind of interaction from the Eye Toy games on the ps2 but with body part detection instead of motion detection.

A simple balloon game that displays 3D balloons on the screen that can be interacted with using a pose detection model. Balloons come from the top of the screen and the objective is to stop them from touching the bottom.

Uses TensorRT to deploy pose detection model and OpenGL for display.
